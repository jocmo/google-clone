The mixed alcohol or mixed oxygenate product contains ethanol and other oxygenates with two or more carbon atoms per molecule. The method includes stripping a portion of carbon dioxide and inert gases contained in a mixed alcohol synthesis reaction product using a methanol-containing stream, such as one produced as part of the method, as a medium to absorb said carbon dioxide and inert gases and recycling light products and heavy products to one or more of synthesis gas generation, mixed alcohol synthesis and separation of desired mixed alcohol or mixed oxygenate products from other components of a mixed alcohol synthesis stream. The present invention also provides downstream processing of the mixed alcohol or mixed oxygenate product by subjecting the product to a dehydration step in order to convert at least ethanol, preferably at least ethanol and propanol, to their correspon",
